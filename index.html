        <h1>Gimbap Recipe</h1>
        <p>
          Kimbap, one of Korea's most popular snacks, can have all sorts of
          fillings; this very classic version is a great place to start.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 large (12-ounce; 340g) cucumber</li>
          <li>Sea or kosher salt</li>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>Vegetable oil, for greasing the pan</li>
          <li>
            6 long strips ham for kimbap (each about 1/4 inch or less thick)
          </li>
          <li>1 medium (8-ounce; 240g) carrot, julienned</li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            2 teaspoons (10ml) grain syrup or oligosaccharide syrup (sold as

          </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce</li>
          <li>
            1 whole danmuji (pickled radish) or 6 pre-cut long danmuji sticks

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Trim cucumber ends and cut it in half lengthwise. Using a spoon,
            scrape out the seeds from each half. Cut each half lengthwise into
            three long strips to make 6 strips total. Place cucumber strips on a
            plate, sprinkle all over with salt, and toss well to coat. Set
            aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, beat eggs with a pinch of salt. Lightly grease a
            10-inch nonstick skillet with vegetable oil and heat over medium
            heat until warmed but not sizzling hot. Add half the egg, swirling
            to cover entire bottom of pan and cook until egg has just set on
            top. Using a rubber spatula, carefully free the egg round and
            transfer to a work surface to cool. Lightly re-grease pan if needed
            and repeat with remaining egg. Wipe out skillet.
          </li>
          <li>Slice egg lengthwise into thin strips. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>
            Rinse cucumber under cold running water, then pat dry with towels,
            squeezing gently to remove excess moisture. Using the same skillet,
            wipe it lightly with more vegetable oil and set over medium-high
            heat until shimmering. Add cucumber and cook until just slightly
            softened, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add ham strips and cook, gently stirring and tossing, until heated
            through, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the carrot to the skillet with a large pinch of salt and cook,
            stirring and tossing, until crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes; if you
            need to add a little more oil to the pan, you can do so at any
            point. Set aside to cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower heat to medium. Add fishcake strips to skillet along with
            oligosaccharide syrup and soy sauce and cook, tossing and stirring,
            until fishcake has softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, mix rice with sesame oil, crushed sesame seeds, and
            1 teaspoon salt. Divide rice into 6 even portions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set a kimbap/sushi rolling mat on a work surface. Set a sheet of
            nori on top of it. Wearing plastic gloves, place a portion of rice
            on the seaweed sheet and use both hands to spread it evenly all
            over, leaving about one or two inches of the sheet exposed at the
            top edge. Dot a few rice grains along the top edge (they will help
            it stick together later).
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrange your fillings across the center of the rice: 1 cucumber
            stick, some egg strips, 1 ham strip, one-sixth of the carrot, some
            of the fishcake strips, 1 danmuji strip, 1 burdock strip, and 1 crab
            stick strip.
          </li>
        </ol>
